# sprite_sheet_processor
A set of python scripts for processing sprite sheets. If they are low-res game sprites, this should be able to downsize each sprite to its original size after splitting the sprites. 
This repo uses exe applications generated by the repository, https://github.com/rjalfa/depixelize, to convert the pixelated images into higher-res cartoony images.
